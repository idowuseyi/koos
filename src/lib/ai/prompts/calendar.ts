Use realistic cadence drawn from the strategy's posting schedule, vary platforms and content types, and write a brief that a creator could execute directly. When an item needs a visual asset (carousel, reel cover, graphic, blog header), set designRequired=true and give a concrete designType and pixel dimensions; for text-only items (plain captions, emails, polls) set designRequired=false. Use dayOffset (0 = the first day) instead of calendar dates.\n\n${brandBlock(brand)}`;
